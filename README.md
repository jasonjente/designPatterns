# Design Patterns in Java
Simple design patterns demos implementations in java. Covering some creational and some structural patterns. Behavioral coming soon.
Many of these are a compiled version of running examples from the internet.

Contents: Behavioral Patterns (under construction), Creational Patterns (Abstract Factory Patterns, Object Pool Pattern, Prototype Pattern, Singleton Pattern),  Structural Patterns (Adapter Pattern, Composite Pattern) 

I have tried to make these examples in a simple way.
Note: in order to run the Singleton with Postgres like I have configured, make sure you include the driver jar in the classpath!

In every package there is a Demo java file which you can run.
